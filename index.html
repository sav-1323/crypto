        <h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as
                a medium of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized
                database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional
                coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. Cryptocurrencies are generally fiat currencies, as
                they are not backed by or convertible into a commodity. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain
                the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they
                get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get
                additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward
                mechanisms.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a
                central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank
                digital currency (CBDC).When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a
                single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each
                cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a
                public financial transaction database.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency.
                Since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money
                called ecash.Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, an early form of
                cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank
                and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital
                currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.
                <br>
                <br>

                In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of
                Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing
                list and later in 1997, in The American Law Review.
                <br>
                <br>

                In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed
                electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold. Like bitcoin and
                other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based
                exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a
                proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published.
                <br>
                <br>

                In 2009, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by presumably pseudonymous
                developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work
                scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which
                would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It
                used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin, used a
                proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.
                <br>
                <br>

                On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what
                role, if any, they could play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation
                should be considered. Its final report was published in 2018, and it issued a consultation on
                cryptoassets and stablecoins in January 2021.
                <br>
                <br>

                In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, after the
                Legislative Assembly had voted 62â€“22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele classifying the
                cryptocurrency as such.
                <br>
                <br>

                In August 2021, Cuba followed with Resolution 215 to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, which will
                circumvent U.S. sanctions.
                <br>
                <br>

                In September 2021, the government of China, the single largest market for cryptocurrency, declared all
                cryptocurrency transactions illegal, completing a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned
                the operation of intermediaries and miners within China.

                <p>
                    Decentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate
                    which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. In centralized banking and
                    economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the
                    supply of currency. In the case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot
                    produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities
                    which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which decentralized
                    cryptocurrencies are based was created by the group or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    As of May 2018, over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed. Within a proof-of-work
                    cryptocurrency system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by
                    a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners: who use their computers to help
                    validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular
                    timestamping scheme.In a proof-of-stake blockchain, transactions are validated by holders
                    of the associated cryptocurrency, sometimes grouped together in stake pools.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a
                    cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.Compared with
                    ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be
                    more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Blockchain</h3>
                <p>
                    The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a
                    continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using
                    cryptography.Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp
                    and transaction data.By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It
                    is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in
                    a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed
                    by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once
                    recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all
                    subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high
                    Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a
                    blockchain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Nodes</h3>
                <p>
                    In the world of Cryptocurrency, a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. The
                    node supports the relevant cryptocurrency's network through either; relaying transactions,
                    validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. In terms of relaying transactions each network
                    computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports, when a transaction
                    is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to
                    other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is
                    known.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organisation or body responsible for
                    developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node
                    to receive rewards from hosting the node network.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Mining</h3>
                <p>
                    In cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful
                    miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a
                    complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating
                    hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such
                    as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.This arms race for
                    cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was introduced
                    in 2009.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has
                    become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve
                    computing performance. Consequently, the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not
                    justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities (to mitigate the heat the equipment
                    produces), and the electricity required to run them. Popular regions for mining include those with
                    inexpensive electricity, a cold climate, and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations. As
                    of July 2019, bitcoin's electricity consumption is estimated to about 7 gigawatts, 0.2% of the
                    global total, or equivalent to that of Switzerland.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward
                    equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A
                    "share" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    As of February 2018, the Chinese Government halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin
                    offerings and shut down mining. Many Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada and Texas.One
                    company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to
                    low gas prices.In June 2018, Hydro Quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 MW
                    to crypto companies for mining.According to a February 2018 report from Fortune, Iceland has become
                    a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.

                <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside existing banking and governmental institutions and are
                    exchanged over the Internet.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Transaction Fees</h3>
                <p>
                    Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time,
                    versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction. The currency
                    holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order
                    of highest offered fee to lowest. Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process
                    for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely
                    cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For ether, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs,
                    while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit.
                    In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017, while for
                    bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55.

                    Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the
                    transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.

                <p>

                    Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.
